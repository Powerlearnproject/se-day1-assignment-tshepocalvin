Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

 - Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools, and methods to create and maintain high-quality
   software solutions.
 - It is important because it allows for the creation of scalable, reliable, and innovative software solutions. Without software engineering
   the technologies of today would be hard to implement, they would be less quality due to a lack of systemized approaches, and their less quality
   builds would be expensive to maintain.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- creation of programming languages
- creation of software engineering principles
- creation of Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Planning - This is the stage of idea generation, gathering user requirements, and system requirements
- Design - The designing of the software's architecture begins, also its user-interfaces
- Implement - Coding and building of the software
- Testing - The software is tested to ensure it meets user requirements and runs up to specified standards.
- Deployment - The software is released to clients
- Maintainance - Updates are made on the software to ensure it stays relevant to times and user requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is sequential while Agile is iterative.
Examples
 - An airline takeoff control system would be suited for Waterfall method as it has clear fixed functionalities.
 - A social media software would be suited for Agile approach as an idea for a new feature might arise during development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- A software developer writes code and develops software
- A QA ensures that quality standards are followed during the planning, development, and delivery of software
- A Project manager is responsible for ensuring a timely delivery of software within budget

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- IDEs allow developers to develop and test code effectively (VS code)
- Version control systems ensure developers can collaborate and publish their code without conflict. (Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Changing requirements - Use agile methodology
- Tight deadlines - Ask for an extension to avoid compromising software quality, plan ahead, and regularly revisit timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit testing - Testing software modules individually
- Integration - Testing integration of different components
- System - Testing the whole system's functionality
- Acceptance - Testing if the product meets user requirements and specified standards

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Is the process of creating questions and statements to attain the best possible response from an AI model.
- Makes the answers from AI specific to your needs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Vague - Tell me about Acer laptops
- Revised - Tell me about Acer's recent gaming laptop
